# WasteBin Project

The WasteBin Project, also known as the Smart Wastebin, aims to tackle the problem of unpleasant odors in small living spaces, such as apartments, while promoting efficient waste separation and environmental conservation. 

By developing a unique device, this project not only prevents unpleasant odors but also encourages users to separate different types of waste, leading to more effective recycling and reduced environmental impact.

This project was developed for [Insyte Technology](https://insyte-technology.nl/).
